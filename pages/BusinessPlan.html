                <h3>Company Description</h3>
                
                <p>Gotchu is an online platform that provides reliable connection and education to clients and freelancers. Our mission is to facilitate the most efficient connection between clients and freelancers and to educate both parties on how to successfully navigate projects.</p><p>

                Understanding our time frame and resources, our business goals that we believe are attainable include getting the website with full functionality up and running so that we can make at least 10(?) client/freelancer connections by the end of the semester. In reflection on last semester, we understand that we will have to rethink our structure and business model in order to make our service more efficient and effective, and we are excited to pursue that.</p><p>

                Looking at the current competitive landscape for freelancing platforms, Gotchu does stand out. What makes Gotchu new, exciting, and attractive is the educational aspect behind it. As we target creators who are looking to begin their freelancing careers, potentially college students and either interested in freelancing on the side or as a full-time commitment, we understand that it can be difficult to get started. Creatives often struggle with valuing their work quantitatively and don’t have a basis of knowledge on how to sell their work and labor to someone who wants it. Gotchu comes in to solve this problem––helping newer freelancers get started by offering recommendations, tips, examples, and tutorials that educate them on their value and how to manage their work and process. Other freelance platforms help with the connection by showing available opportunities, but the educational aspect and overall reliable project management is not addressed.</p><p>

                The Gotchu platform is based on a website. On this site, the client or freelancer can sign up by filling out a simple form describing either the work they’re looking to be completed (client) or the skills they have experience and would like to contribute. Although it may not be scalable in the future, for now, the Gotchu team is making the client/freelancer connections, rather than the clients and freelancers making the connections themselves on the website.</p>

                <h3>The Service</h3>
                
                <p>Gotchu provides assistance in numerous steps in the freelancing process. First, we help pair a client with a freelancer by giving them the ability to look over existing work. Then, once the client decides whether a specific freelancer is to their liking, he/she can reach out, therefore commencing the chain of events in our expertise. Gotchu is a tremendous learning experience for those just starting out in this industry; or it’ll just add further insight to those well established in the game. Either way, Gotchu makes sure both sides of a contractual agreement will get what they want by the end of the project. This includes steps on both how to secure the freelancer, how to value work properly, and how to clearly state what the client wants out of the job. </p><p>

                There will be a rooted “growth track” in order to retain freelancers on our site from the beginning of their careers to their dominance at the top. Through ratings and cumulative experience, we can maximize our product lifecycle and not be discarded after a one-time use. We keep track of all freelancers on our service (inventory) but leave it up to the clients to spark that first connection. </p>
                
                <h4>KPIs:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sign ups by freelancers</li>

                <h4>Checkpoint</h4>
                    <p>Gotchu’s product/platform is made for students in USC student’s to connect services and needs with one another. Our product does compare to other compares because of the platform, but our customer segments is the differentiating factor. This product does have the potential to change the industry through colleges because of our organized structure and approach. The business structure does have potential to change simply because our values focus on catering toward college students and spreading the knowledge and power of freelance. </p>
                    <p>Our team is relatively small, but each individual’s roles are clearly defined and organized to allow rotation of roles so we can continue innovation with our service.  </p>

                <h3>Marketing and Sales Strategies</h3>
                
                <p>Gotchu’s plan to become scalable is primarily through the acquisition of new clients. We can then use the client’s offerings to attract new freelancers. While this is a ‘chicken or the egg’ type of situation, we believe the job listings will be an effective method of attracting freelancers from established platforms. We also offer a system of pricing your work based on the demand for the service being provided and the previous work experience of the freelancer. We assume that this will be an effective method of bringing new freelancers into the industry, as pricing is often a major difficulty. </p><p>

                In terms of revenue generation, our plan is to collect a set fee from each transaction. We understand that this could increase our liability, and we will be evaluating ways to limit this moving forward. As our market expands, we would also like to focus on the educational aspect of freelancing and bringing new freelancers into the industry.</p>

                <h3>Funding Requests</h3>
                
                <p>In terms of our funding requirements, it is our goal to raise $25,0000-$50,000 within the next year, $100,000 the following year, and scaling upwards based on need and sales from then on out. The funds would go towards not only building and maintaining the Gotchu platform, but also be employed for marketing, partnerships with corporate brands, and the employment of software development professionals to enhance the product’s ability to help new freelancers achieve their goals (incorporate AI, machine learning, etc... ).

                <h3>Legal Structure</h3>
                
                <p>We intend to structure Gotchu as a C-Corporation in order to pursue external funding from venture capital firms and shield individuals within the company from liability. We are aware that this will entail registering the business name and filing a certificate of incorporation, and that such procedures will require a fee. We are also prepared to draft corporate bylaws and hold a board of director’s meeting.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Robustness</h3>
                
                <p>For an investor, we want to reassure you that we as a company have a relatively low risk associated, but also a very high reward potential. Looking at the revenue forecast for our best case scenario, we believe that Gotchu has the potential to boom - and its growth rate will only increase. Every time the Gotchu platform grows in size, so too does our network, meaning, the more freelancers and clients available on our platform, the higher the potential to attract new ones. We believe that with with every freelancer we add, our platform has the potential for exponential growth, and has high potential for optimal scalability. Our maximum likelihood case exhibits this as well - with a thoughtful infusion of cash, we believe that we could even bring this curve to match the great success of our maximum likelihood case and rapidly increase in size. </p>

<p>As for the worst case, we believe that we have a decent sized runway currently in place in which we can maintain a similar structure and pricing for our company if the worst were to unfortunately occur. With careful planning and cost cutting at our minimum acceptable cash point, we believe that we can extend this runway out even further and quickly turn our misfortune into rapid profit with the additional time that we have.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Market Reasearch </h3>
                
                <p>Studies such as Freelancing in America 2018 revealed that there are 56.7 million Americans doing freelance work today and 64% of them are finding opportunities online. This is compared to  53 million and 42% in 2014, respectively. </p>

                <p>Online platforms such as Fiverr report having 830,000 freelancers and 5.5 million clients to facilitate an average of 50 million monthly transactions. </p>

                <p>The freelance industry is difficult to quantify overall because it is influenced by both measurable segments such as online freelancing platforms and non-measurable segments such as word-of-mouth and social media postings, many freelancers and clients use more than one of these avenues for exposure, and since it inherently lacks structure and hierarchy. Furthermore, the segment of the market Gotchu seeks to capture is largely untapped since we focus on introducing people would not otherwise participate in freelancing to the line of work to—specifically U.S.-based college students. </p>

                <p>Gotchu’s scope is its greatest value proposition to its customers. Restricting the freelancers to U.S.-based college students offers the freelancers opportunities to be compensated and find work without competing against professionals, while clients enjoy favorable prices. Furthermore, U.S. freelancers who would usually opt for word-of-mouth over global platforms that create competition against those in parts of the world where the cost of living is much lower, are now able to enjoy the benefits of online correspondence and exposure without such drawbacks.</p> 

                <p>The freelance industry is currently not heavily regulated, but local and state governments have begun introducing legislation intended to fairly define and compensate freelance work. California’s AB5, for example, makes it more difficult for companies to classify their workers as independent contractors instead of full-time employees. While this affects the freelance process itself, Gotchu’s decision to focus on connection-building and task management as opposed to payment facilitation shields the company from regulatory measures and legal obligations.</p>
