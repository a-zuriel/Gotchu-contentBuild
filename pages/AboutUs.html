        <p>Here in Iovine and Young, we all learn a wide variety of skills and tools. In addition, many students come into the Academy already with business-standard skills in many areas. We want to be able to utilize our skills that we learn outside of our classes. We learn such unique skills and want to be able to apply them. That being said, we realized that we didn't know proper etiquate on how to go about free lancing. That lead us to creating Gotchu.</p>
        <p>
        Gotchu is intended to help people understand how they can apply their skills in the freelancing realm. We hope that through our platform, everybody will understand how they can best utilize their skills to freelance. Whether they are hoping to do art for a family friend, or create a youtube channel intro for a major youtuber, our hope is that through our platform, all freelancers, and individuals looking to get into freelancing, will feel comfortable on putting themselves out there and having a successful experience.
