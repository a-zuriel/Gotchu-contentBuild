                Before I started using Gotchu, I knew nothing about design. Gotchu taught me all the basics of UI/UX design as well as how to use softwares like Figma. <br><br>Now I can proudly say that I've been hired for two freelance UI/UX projects through Gotchu!

                I wanted to learn how to code for so long and tried various online courses like Codeademy, but after I finished the courses I was lost figuring out what to do now. <br><br> Then my friend told me about Gotchu which actually guided me through building a portfolio and helped connect me with real freelance opportunities. I actually got several freelance jobs with Gotchu writing code and couldn't be happier. <br><br>I would highly reccomend this platform for any beginners looking to grow into real life opportunities!

                Gotchu is by far the easiest platform to build up a portfolio from the start and become a freelancer. It gives you absolutely all the tools you need- I am beyond impressed. <br><br> As a mother of two college students, I've watched them both sign up for Gotchu and begin their freelance careers through the app. <br><br>I am so happy that young people these days have something like this and wish it existed when I was trying to become a freelancer 20 years ago.
